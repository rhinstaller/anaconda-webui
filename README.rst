Anaconda Web UI
===============

Getting the source
------------------

Here's where to get the code::

    git clone https://github.com/rhinstaller/anaconda.git
    cd anaconda

Running eslint
--------------

Anaconda Web UI uses `ESLint <https://eslint.org/>`_ to automatically check
JavaScript code style in `.js` and `.jsx` files.

The linter is executed within every build as a plugin of esbuild.

For developer convenience, the ESLint can be started explicitly by::

    npm run eslint

Violations of some rules can be fixed automatically by::

    npm run eslint:fix

Rules configuration can be found in the `.eslintrc.json` file.

Development with rsync mode
---------------------------

When developing the Web UI, after every change to your sources we need to re-build
and the contents of dist directory need to be copied to the SSH target's
/usr/share/cockpit/anaconda-webui directory.

For automating this, you need to set up the SSH `test-updates` alias,
as described in `<test/README.rst>`_.

Then you can run::

    make rsync
